    <description>This project started off inside a Windows Forms project called Transparency Maker, which I am porting to a Blazor project so I can put it online.

This project has just been ported from .Net Framework, and most things appear to work but this has not been thoroughly tested.</description>
    <releaseNotes>1.0.6: I have been working on this project for several weeks, and I need to update Nuget.

1.0.5: I fixed a bug where Swap Colors was not taking the Alpha into account from the previous color.

1.0.4: I made some changes while working on the .Net Framework version, and I am trying to keep them in sync. The changes involved I added a new draw line in color feature, a new feature for LastUpdate can always be queried by:

Update
blah blah blah
Where
Pixels In LastUpdate

Also some changes to the Draw Line, which is still very slow, but now a message shows.
I need to create an abort for Draw Line, just haven't had a chance yet. I will work on this some more next week.

1.0.3: I added a new override to PixelDatabaseLoder for ImageUrl.

1.0.2: I had forgot to list the Project Url, as well as the description changed from untested, to lightly tested.

1.0.1: Changed TargetFramework netcoreapp3.1 to TargetFrameworks netstandard2.1;netcoreapp3.1

First release, i will update the rest of the info if it gets past proof of concept.</releaseNotes>
